# DeepNeuralNetwork_PUBG_Rankings
The video game 'PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' (PUBG) pits 100 players against one another as they aim to become the last man standing.

This project aims to collect data regarding player performance from thousands of games in order to determine which player actions are most correlated with winning performances.

We aim to use a neural network designed with the python package Keras in order to be able to predict, based on player actions, which players were most or least likely to succeed.
